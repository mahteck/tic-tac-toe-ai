# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

## ðŸ§© Product Overview

This is an implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where you can play either against an AI opponent or against another player in **Multiplayer mode**. The AI is powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, making optimal moves based on the current state of the board to provide a challenging experience.

The game is built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, making it an interactive, browser-based game that can be played directly from the web.

### ðŸŽ® Game Modes:
- **Player vs AI**: Take on the AI that plays smart using Minimax logic.
- **Multiplayer (P1 vs P2)**: Play locally with a friend, turn by turn.
