# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

## Product Overview

This is an implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where you can play against an AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI makes optimal moves based on the current state of the board to provide a challenging experience. The game is built using Python and Streamlit, making it an interactive, browser-based game that can be played directly from the web.

The main features of the game include:
- **Interactive UI**: Built using Streamlit for a simple and responsive user interface.
- **AI Opponent**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves.
- **Player vs AI**: Play against the AI or restart the game when it's over.
- **Game Results**: Displays win or tie results and allows for game reset.

## Features
- **Play against AI**: Engage in a game where the AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Alternating turns between the player (X) and AI (O).
- **Game Result**: The game will display a message when a player or the AI wins, or if there is a tie.
- **Reset Game**: After the game ends, you can easily reset the board to start a new game.
